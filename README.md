# pydrobert-pytorch

PyTorch utilities for Machine Learning. This is an eclectic mix of utilities
that I've used in my various projects. There is a definite leaning towards
speech, specifically end-to-end ASR. The primary benefit `pydrobert-pytorch`
has over other packages is modularity: you can pick and choose the
functionality you desire without subscribing to an entire ecosystem. You can
find out more about what the package offers in the documentation links below.

**This is student-driven code, so don't expect a stable API. I'll try to use
semantic versioning, but the best way to keep functionality stable is by
pinning the version in the requirements or by forking.**
